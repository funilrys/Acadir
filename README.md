# Welcome

This is a simple (maybe be complex) MVC framework used for building web applications in PHP. 
It's also my first project with the concepts of **Orientent-Object Programming** and **Model-View-Controller**.

Please follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/funilrys/Acadir/wiki) for more informations/advices about download, configuration and more.
